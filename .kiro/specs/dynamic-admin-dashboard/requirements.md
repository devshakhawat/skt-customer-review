# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a WordPress plugin admin dashboard system similar to Elementor's interface, allowing developers to dynamically create form fields (switchers, text fields, etc.) from PHP code. The system will handle field creation, data management, and frontend rendering using modern JavaScript/React/Next.js technologies. This will provide a flexible, extensible admin interface that can be easily customized and extended.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a WordPress plugin developer, I want to define admin dashboard fields programmatically in PHP, so that I can create dynamic admin interfaces without writing repetitive HTML/CSS code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer defines a field configuration in PHP THEN the system SHALL automatically generate the corresponding admin interface element
2. WHEN a developer specifies field types (text, switcher, select, textarea, etc.) THEN the system SHALL render the appropriate input component
3. WHEN a developer sets field properties (label, description, default value, validation rules) THEN the system SHALL apply these properties to the rendered field
4. WHEN a developer groups fields into sections THEN the system SHALL organize the admin interface with proper sectioning and layout

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a WordPress plugin developer, I want the admin dashboard to save and retrieve field values automatically, so that I don't have to handle database operations manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user saves the admin form THEN the system SHALL store all field values in the WordPress database
2. WHEN the admin page loads THEN the system SHALL retrieve and populate all field values from the database
3. WHEN field values are updated THEN the system SHALL validate the data before saving
4. WHEN saving fails due to validation errors THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a WordPress plugin developer, I want the frontend to render using modern JavaScript frameworks, so that the admin interface is responsive and provides a smooth user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin page loads THEN the system SHALL render the interface using React or similar modern framework
2. WHEN a user interacts with form fields THEN the system SHALL provide real-time feedback and validation
3. WHEN form data changes THEN the system SHALL update the interface without full page reloads
4. WHEN the system encounters errors THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with proper styling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a WordPress plugin developer, I want to extend the field types and customize the appearance, so that I can create unique admin interfaces for different plugins.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer needs custom field types THEN the system SHALL provide hooks and filters to register new field types
2. WHEN a developer wants to customize styling THEN the system SHALL support custom CSS and theme overrides
3. WHEN a developer needs conditional field display THEN the system SHALL support field dependencies and conditional logic
4. WHEN a developer wants to add custom validation THEN the system SHALL provide extensible validation mechanisms

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want the admin dashboard to be intuitive and accessible, so that I can easily configure plugin settings without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the admin dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a clean, organized interface
2. WHEN an administrator hovers over fields THEN the system SHALL show helpful tooltips and descriptions
3. WHEN an administrator makes changes THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about save status
4. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL be accessible and comply with WordPress accessibility standards

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a WordPress plugin developer, I want the system to integrate seamlessly with existing WordPress admin patterns, so that it feels native to the WordPress ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin dashboard renders THEN the system SHALL use WordPress admin styling and conventions
2. WHEN the system handles data THEN the system SHALL use WordPress nonces and security measures
3. WHEN the system processes requests THEN the system SHALL follow WordPress AJAX and REST API patterns
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL integrate with WordPress admin notices and error handling
